# Iteration 2 

After testing iteration 1 storyboard with my peers and tutor, I received feedback on the complexity of the mirror reflection regarding the trial on thing. Moreover, the product's make and feel of the texture would be complex to work on with the given time constraint, I decided on altering my storyboard thus making changes in the iteration 2.

Each simple gesture creates a feeling of shopping in person for the user. Instead of choosing the mirror reflection, I initiated on implementing Avatar of the individual wearing the headset. This can provide privacy of the person as well. 

Each gesture has a move in the entire vitual world of shopping experience journey such as actions like grabbing from rack, putting clothes on Avatar, thumbs up for putting in cart, round motion for similar suggestions, palm put to stop shopping and checkout, ok hand gesture for to receive combinations to go on current choice.
